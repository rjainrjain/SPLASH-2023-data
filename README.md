This repository houses preliminary test results data for the poster "Generating Domain-Specific Programs for Diagram Authoring with Large Language Models", submitted to SPLASH 2023. 

In the `json` folder, see the `no-sample` folder for data for the prompt variations with a BNF-style grammar or with a Domain schema program and no standalone sample program; see the `sample` folder for data for the prompt variations with a BNF-style grammar or with a Domain schema program which include standalone sample programs.

In the `svg` folder, see the `no-sample` and `sample` folders for the diagrams resulting from successfully compiling programs generated by GPT-4 corresponding to the prompt variations in `json`.

See https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/rijul/edgeworth-llm-ui/packages/edgeworth/src/scripts/testLLM.ts for the script that produced this data.

That should be everything you need to replicate our results, as far as is possible with the unpredictability introduced by setting the temperature of GPT-4 to 0.7, as we did.
