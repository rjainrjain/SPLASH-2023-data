This repository houses preliminary test results data for the poster "Generating Domain-Specific Programs for Diagram Authoring with Large Language Models", submitted to SPLASH 2023. 

In the `json` folder, see the `BNF` folder for data for the prompt variation with a BNF-style grammar and no standalone sample program; see the `Domain` folder for data for the prompt variation with a Domain schema program and no standalone sample program.

In the `svg` folder, see the `BNF` and `Domain` folders for the diagrams resulting from successfully compiling programs generated by GPT-4.


That should be everything you need to replicate our results, as far as is possible with the unpredictability introduced by setting the temperature of GPT-4 to 0.7, as we did.
